With cyberattacks becoming more frequent and costly, organizations must adopt advanced security measures to protect their systems. **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)** play a crucial role by monitoring networks and devices for suspicious activity. There are two main types: **Host-based IDS (HIDS)**, which detects threats on individual devices, and **Network-based IDS (NIDS)**, which monitors network traffic. Both help identify and respond to security risks in real time, strengthening overall cybersecurity.

### How IDS Detect Threats?

#### 1 - Signature-Based Detection (SBD):
This method works like a **wanted list** for cyber threats. It looks for specific, predefined patterns or **signatures** of known threats. If the system spots a match, it flags it as malicious. For example, if a virus always leaves behind the same **fingerprint,** signature-based detection will immediately recognize and block it.

#### 2 - Anomaly-Based Detection (ABD):
This method doesn’t rely on known patterns. Instead, it learns what **normal** behavior looks like in a system and watches for anything unusual. For example, if a user suddenly starts downloading massive amounts of data late at night—something they’ve never done before—anomaly-based detection will flag it as suspicious

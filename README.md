# README - Cybersecurity Threat Detection: A Comparative Analysis of IDS Detection Paradigms

## Overview

This document presents an in-depth exploration of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and their detection methodologies, specifically focusing on two primary paradigms: Anomaly-Based Detection (ABD) and Signature-Based Detection (SBD). The article is structured into several sections, each providing insights into the technical foundations, strengths, limitations, real-world applications, and emerging trends in IDS. The purpose of this research is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the IDS landscape, offering a foundation for future advancements in cybersecurity technologies.

## Research Methodology

The research is divided into phases, ensuring a structured and collaborative approach to the writing process:

### 1. **Research Phase (All Members)**
   - Divide research into specialized domains: Machine Learning algorithms, pattern-matching algorithms, real-world IDS deployment, and case studies.
   - Source peer-reviewed articles, industry reports, and whitepapers.

### 2. **Writing and Review Phase**
   - Use LaTeX for scientific formatting and Git for version control.
   - Peer-review sections focusing on technical accuracy, academic integrity, and logical flow.

### 3. **Final Integration and Editing**
   - Ensure consistent terminology, formal tone, and technical depth.
   - Include citations in IEEE or APA format.

## Collaboration Guidelines

We emphasize a collaborative writing approach using version control tools (e.g., Git). All contributors should:

- Ensure proper referencing of sources.
- Maintain technical accuracy and logical consistency.
- Provide feedback and suggestions during the peer review phase.
